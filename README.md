# Data-mining

- The core purpose of Data Mining is to unearth important information in a dataset and make the best use of this to discover and decode future trends.
- Data Mining also incorporates data cleaning, pattern prediction, statistical analysis, data conversion, machine learning, and data visualization.

# Data mining - Association Rule Mining

## Prerequisite – Frequent Item set in Data set.
Apriori Property –
All non-empty subset of frequent itemset must be frequent. The key concept of Apriori algorithm is its anti-monotonicity of support measure.





# Data Mining - Cluster Analysis

Clustering is the process of making a group of abstract objects into classes of similar objects.

- Requirements of Clustering in Data Mining
  - Scalability 
  - Ability to deal with different kinds of attributes
  - Discovery of clusters with attribute shape
  - High dimensionality
  - Ability to deal with noisy data
  - Interpretability
  
  I have implemented K-means cluster with initial seed selection and K-medoids clustering algorithm.
