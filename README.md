# Data-mining

- The core purpose of Data Mining is to unearth important information in a dataset and make the best use of this to discover and decode future trends.
- Data Mining also incorporates data cleaning, pattern prediction, statistical analysis, data conversion, machine learning, and data visualization.

# Association Rule Mining
An association rule has 2 parts:

- an antecedent (if) and
- a consequent (then)
An antecedent is something that’s found in data, and a consequent is an item that is found in combination with the antecedent. Have a look at this rule for instance:

“If a customer buys bread, he’s 70% likely of buying milk.”

Apriori algorithms: 
Prerequisite – Frequent Item set in Data set.
- All subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent(Apriori propertry).
- If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.

I have implemented #### Apriori algorithm.
# Cluster Analysis

Clustering is the process of making a group of abstract objects into classes of similar objects.

- Requirements of Clustering in Data Mining
  - Scalability 
  - Ability to deal with different kinds of attributes
  - Discovery of clusters with attribute shape
  - High dimensionality
  - Ability to deal with noisy data
  - Interpretability
  
  I have implemented #### K-means cluster with initial seed selection and #### K-medoids clustering algorithm.
